efficient, which can lead to increased profitability and competitiveness for the organization. Second, high-performing
teams tend to be more innovative and adaptable, allowing the organization to respond more effectively to changes in the
market and external environment.</p><p>As a leader, creating high-performing teams can also enhance your reputation and career prospects. When you are able to
build and lead successful teams, you are more likely to be seen as a valuable asset to the organization, and you may be
given more opportunities for advancement and leadership roles in the future.</p><p>Radical Candor is a leadership approach that emphasizes the importance of building strong relationships with employees
while also challenging them to grow and improve. Developed by Kim Scott, a Silicon Valley veteran who has worked at
companies like Google, Apple, and Twitter, Radical Candor has gained a lot of attention in recent years as a powerful
tool for creating high-performing teams.</p><p>At its core, Radical Candor is about balancing caring and directness. Leaders who practice Radical Candor are able to
provide honest feedback to their employees while also showing that they care about their well-being and success. This
approach is particularly important in today&rsquo;s fast-paced business environment, where employees need feedback in order to
stay competitive and grow.</p><p>One of the key components of Radical Candor is creating a culture of feedback. This means creating an environment where
employees feel comfortable giving and receiving feedback from their colleagues and superiors. By creating this culture,
employees are able to learn from each other and grow more quickly than they would otherwise.</p><p>Another important aspect of Radical Candor is the concept of &ldquo;ruinous empathy.&rdquo; This refers to situations where leaders
prioritize kindness over honesty, which can prevent employees from receiving the feedback necessary to improve. In order
to avoid ruinous empathy, leaders need to be willing to challenge their employees and provide honest feedback when
necessary.</p><p>One of the most challenging aspects of Radical Candor is giving feedback effectively. According to Scott, effective
feedback requires a combination of specificity and empathy. Leaders need to be specific about what they are observing
and provide clear examples of the behavior they want to see changed. At the same time, they need to be empathetic and
understand how their feedback might be received by the employee.</p><p>To give feedback effectively, Scott recommends using &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements rather than &ldquo;you&rdquo; statements. For example, instead
of saying &ldquo;You need to work on your communication skills,&rdquo; a leader might say, &ldquo;I noticed that in the meeting today, it
was difficult to follow your point. What do you think we could do to make sure everyone is on the same page?&rdquo;</p><p>Let&rsquo;s see a complete example to appreciate the difference between the two types of feedback.</p><hr><p><em>Employee: I&rsquo;ve been having trouble meeting my sales targets lately. I&rsquo;m not sure what I&rsquo;m doing wrong.</em></p><p><em>Manager: Oh, don&rsquo;t worry about it. You&rsquo;re doing fine. Sales is a tough business, and sometimes it takes a while to get the hang of it.</em></p><hr><p>In this example, the manager is demonstrating ruinous empathy by avoiding giving the employee direct and honest
feedback. By downplaying the employee&rsquo;s concerns and failing to offer specific guidance or suggestions for improvement,
the manager is actually doing the employee a disservice. Instead of addressing the root causes of the employee&rsquo;s
performance issues, the manager is enabling the employee to continue making the same mistakes and potentially damaging
their career prospects.</p><p>A more effective approach would be for the manager to provide direct and specific feedback that can help the employee
improve their performance. For example:</p><hr><p><em>Manager: I appreciate you coming to me with your concerns. It&rsquo;s important to me that you succeed in your role here.
Based on what I&rsquo;ve seen, I think there are a few areas where you could improve your sales performance. Specifically,
I&rsquo;ve noticed that you&rsquo;re not always following up with leads in a timely manner, and your product knowledge could be
stronger. Let&rsquo;s work together to develop a plan to help you improve in these areas, and I&rsquo;ll provide the support and
resources you need to be successful.</em></p><hr><p>In this example, the manager is demonstrating Radical Candor by caring personally about the employee&rsquo;s success, while
also challenging them directly to improve their performance. The feedback is specific, actionable, and delivered in a
respectful and empathetic manner, which is more likely to motivate the employee to take ownership of their performance
and work towards improvement.</p><p>Another important aspect of Radical Candor is being willing to receive feedback as a leader. This can be challenging, as
leaders often feel like they need to have all the answers. However, by being open to feedback from employees, leaders
can model the behavior they want to see in their teams and create a culture of continuous improvement.</p><p>Overall, Radical Candor is a powerful tool for creating high-performing teams. By balancing caring and directness,
creating a culture of feedback, and giving feedback effectively, leaders can help their employees grow and improve.
While it can be challenging to practice Radical Candor, the benefits are clear: teams that are built on a foundation of
honest feedback and strong relationships are more resilient and better able to adapt to change.</p></div></article><ul class=component-donation><div class=row><div class="col alert alert-info" role=alert><a href=https://ko-fi.com/mangasfproject><h2 class=alert-heading>‚òï Invite me to a coffe!</h2><p>One of the objectives of the Mangasf Project is the dissemination of content.
