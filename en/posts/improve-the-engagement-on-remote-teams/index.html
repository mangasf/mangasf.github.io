can work from home one or more days a week. Some companies even ventured to implement it completely, in some cases
without physical offices.</p><p>If we talk about companies with remote work models, we have to mention Basecamp. The American company specializing in
the creation of project management software has never had a head office. Since its beginnings they have opted to work
with teams distributed all over the world and remote work has been the backbone of their talent recruitment and
retention model.</p><p>Basecamp&rsquo;s founders, Jason Freid and David Heinemeier, documented their experience with remote Work in their
book <a href=https://basecamp.com/books/remote>&ldquo;Remote: Office Not Required&rdquo;</a>. In the book they recount the benefits of
remote work. It is a perfect handbook for any company that wants to implement this way of working.</p><h3 id=the-global-adoption-of-remote-work>The global adoption of remote work</h3><p>We are in the year 2024, in the technology sector we have experienced a radical change in the way of working after
the global pandemic we experienced in 2020.</p><p>This remote work model was enhanced by the pandemic that we suffered in 2020. There is no doubt that in the last four
years remote work models, in any of their aspects, have evolved more than in all previous years in this sector.</p><p>The development of these work models has forced companies and employees to adapt in order to continue operating in the
same way they did it until now. The benefits for employees and companies are indisputable but also some problems have
arisen that have required adapting processes and looking for new ways of working.</p><h3 id=disadvantages-of-remote-work>&ldquo;Disadvantages&rdquo; of remote work</h3><p>Some of the problems that have been identified over the years regarding remote work include the following:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Communication and collaboration</strong>: Effective communication can be more difficult in a remote environment, especially
when relying on digital tools. The lack of face-to-face interaction can hinder collaboration and team problem-solving.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disconnection and boundaries</strong>: With remote work, it&rsquo;s easy for the boundaries between work and personal life to
blurred. Many employees struggle to disconnect from work and establish healthy boundaries, which can
lead to work fatigue and burnout.</p></li><li><p><strong>Technology and access to resources</strong>: Not all employees have access to adequate technology or a reliable Internet
connection at home, which can lead to work fatigue and burnout. Internet connection in their homes, which can hinder
their ability to perform their jobs effectively.</p></li><li><p><strong>Distractions at home</strong>: Working from home can present a number of distractions, such as background noise,
interruptions from family members or pets, which can affect productivity and concentration.</p></li><li><p><strong>Isolation and lack of social connection</strong>: Remote work can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness,
especially for those who are used to a social office environment. Lack of social interaction can negatively affect
employees&rsquo; mental health and emotional well-being.</p></li></ul><h3 id=adapting-to-change>Adapting to change</h3><p>When implementing a remote work model it will be crucial, as in any form of work, to make agreements within the team.
These internal agreements will help the team understand how they will collaborate in this new framework.</p><p>Feedback sessions will be key so that the team can take action to improve and avoid communication or collaboration
problems. There is no theoretical method whose application will allow any team to work in the most optimal way in a
remote model. Each team is different, made up of people with different sensitivities and therefore the best model is the
one that they define themselves with the help of their Manager.</p><p>A key element to be able to work on these points of improvement will be that the team can rely on metrics. Numbers
that the team feels comfortable with and can see the impact that their changes have on their performance.</p><p><strong>How do you help your team define the way they work remotely?</strong></p><p>A best practice is to help the team extract improvement actions in feedback sessions. These sessions can be held on a
regular basis and will allow the team to pivot and adapt the framework models to the way that best suits them.</p><p>For example, there are teams that work better in asynchronous, they do not need a lot of videoconferencing to have good
delivery of value. In other cases, the opposite is true, we have very dynamic teams that need regular meetings to avoid
isolation and achieve good collaboration.</p><p><strong>Emotional well-being</strong></p><p>Beyond performance we have to keep in mind that remote work has in most cases an impact on the way we relate to our team
members. To avoid social isolation and to work on our team culture, it is convenient to be able to organize face-to-face
team activities from time to time.</p><p>Bonding Days are events organized by companies to strengthen the bonds between teams and promote group cohesion. This
type of events can help us in the previous point. If you want to know more about them we recommend

They can tailor their workday according to their personal needs, which can lead to a better work-life balance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Saving time and money</strong>: By eliminating the time and costs associated with commuting to work, employees can save
money on transportation, travel, and other costs. They can also take advantage of time previously spent commuting
to be more productive or for personal activities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Increased productivity</strong>: Many employees find that they are more productive working from home, as they are able to
avoid distractions and interruptions common in the office environment. In addition, the flexibility of being able to
work at the time of day when they are most productive can improve their efficiency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reduced stress and better mental health</strong>: For some employees, remote work can reduce the stress associated with
commuting and the work environment. It also allows employees to create a work environment that suits their needs and
preferences, which can contribute to better mental health and well-being.</p></li><li><p><strong>Talent attraction and retention</strong>: Offering remote work options can make a company more attractive to certain
candidates, especially those who live and work remotely.</p></li></ul><h3 id=conclusions>Conclusions</h3><p>Remote work models are here to stay. Today, these work models are valued by employees and a competitive advantage for
those companies that know how to apply them efficiently.</p><p>As a manager, it is important that you equip your teams with the tools to make the most of this new way of working.
Understanding the composition of your team and their needs and helping them to adapt to the change of
model will be essential to ensure their well-being and the associated value delivery.</p></div></article><ul class=component-donation><div class=row><div class="col alert alert-info" role=alert><a href=https://ko-fi.com/mangasfproject><h2 class=alert-heading>‚òï Invite us to a coffe!</h2><p>One of the objectives of the Mangasf Project is the dissemination of content.
