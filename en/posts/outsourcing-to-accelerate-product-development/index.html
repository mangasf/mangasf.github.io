<p>There are different moments in the development of a product in which market times or other factors make
you cannot reach internally the speed of development that your business needs. On these occasions the <em>Outsourcing</em> or
outsourcing the development of parts of your product can be an interesting solution to your problem.</p>
<p><em>Outsourcing</em> in the world of software is the process by which a company chooses to outsource to a company
external services related to the development of a technological product. This may include the implementation,
Software management and maintenance.</p>
<p>There are different types of <em>Outsourcing</em>, let&rsquo;s briefly see some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project outsourcing</strong>: this model outsources modules or entire products by establishing
a start and end date. Its use is frequent in companies that need specific IT services that are not part of
the company&rsquo;s main roadmap. Normally associated with outsourcing where the maintainability of the product is not
It is a determining factor for the company.</li>
<li><strong>Outsourcing of goals</strong>: this model does not consist of outsourcing the development of a project but rather the ability to
achieve a company goal. It usually occurs in companies that need to achieve certain objectives but do not have the
suitable specialists (they know the what but not the how).</li>
<li><strong>Outsourcing of strength or capabilities</strong>: on this occasion the company knows the what and the how but needs more
development capacity to achieve their goals. It is common to resort to hiring external profiles to
increase the capacity of internal teams.</li>
</ul>
<p>This last model of outsourcing is my favorite and with which I have achieved the best results in my projects.
It allows you to have specialized personnel that increase the capabilities of your teams and integrate quickly. It produces a
easy collaboration between external and internal team members by working within the same operating structure.</p>
<p>In addition, by having these external members within your team you will be able to mitigate some main problems of the
<em>Outsourcing</em>, how are the generation of knowledge silos in the external company or the lack of control over the
projects you have outsourced. All the work will be done within your internal teams with specialists
that will increase their production capacity, all this by sharing the processes and culture of your company.</p>
<h3 id=outsourcing-of-non-core-services>Outsourcing of non-core services</h3>
<p>The core services of your application, unlike the non-core ones, are those that directly affect the value that your
company or product offers its customers. These services have a direct impact on the benefits of your company and therefore,
having full control over its functionality and performance is key to it.</p>
<p>On the contrary, non-core or secondary services are those that are necessary for the day-to-day running of your business.
but they do not provide a differential competitive advantage to it. It is interesting to outsource development and
maintenance of these services to allow your internal teams to focus on the strategic plan of your
company.</p>
<p>Outsourcing this type of task will allow you to reduce the costs of purely operational tasks, while maintaining
Internal teams focused on motivating and high-impact tasks for your business.</p>
<h3 id=conclution>Conclution</h3>
<p>When we talk about <em>Outsourcing</em> in the IT world, it is important that we choose the strategy that best suits the
needs of our team. We must think about the type of service that we are going to outsource and the method that we will use
for it. This will allow us to increase our development capabilities without taking our internal teams away from the
implementation of the company&rsquo;s technology strategy.</p>
